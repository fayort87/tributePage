                <p>Steve Jobs, born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California, was a visionary entrepreneur and
                    co-founder of Apple Inc. His journey in technology began in his parents' garage, where he and his
                    friend Steve Wozniak built their first computer, the Apple I, in 1976. This marked the inception of
                    what would become one of the most influential companies in the world.

                    In 1977, Apple released the Apple II, which revolutionized the personal computing industry with its
                    user-friendly design and graphical interface. However, it was the launch of the Macintosh in 1984
                    that truly showcased Jobs' commitment to innovation and design excellence. The Macintosh introduced
                    the world to the concept of a computer for the rest of us, featuring a mouse-driven interface and
                    iconic advertising campaign directed by Ridley Scott.

                    Despite early successes, Jobs experienced setbacks during his tenure at Apple, leading to his
                    departure from the company in 1985. Undeterred, he went on to found NeXT Inc., a computer platform
                    development company, and later acquired Pixar Animation Studios, where he served as CEO. Under his
                    leadership, Pixar created groundbreaking animated films such as "Toy Story," "Finding Nemo," and
                    "The Incredibles."

                    In 1997, Jobs returned to Apple when the company acquired NeXT. His visionary leadership revitalized
                    the struggling tech giant, leading to the introduction of groundbreaking products such as the iMac,
                    iPod, iPhone, and iPad. Jobs' relentless pursuit of perfection and focus on user experience cemented
                    Apple's reputation as an industry leader and cultural phenomenon.

                    Steve Jobs passed away on October 5, 2011, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire
                    entrepreneurs, innovators, and dreamers around the world.
